# README for **JSON and jQuery Product Listing**  

- Online URL: [https://varleenbiketi.github.io/Web-development-projects/Json/json2.html] 

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **JSON data handling and jQuery interactions** by creating a product listing system. The project consists of **three parts**:  

1. **Creating and displaying JSON data** (`json1.html`)  
2. **Reading JSON from an external file and displaying it dynamically** (`json2.html`)  
3. **Filtering products based on category selection** (`json3.html`)  

## Deliverables  
- **Code Files:**  
  - `json1.html` – Defines a JSON object, converts it to a string, and displays it  
  - `products.json` – Contains structured product data  
  - `json2.html` – Reads `products.json` and displays product details dynamically  
  - `json3.html` – Reads `products.json`, allows category filtering, and displays matching products  


## Features Implemented  
✅ **JSON structure with at least 12 products**  
✅ **Products categorized under at least 3 different categories**  
✅ **Supports multiple categories per product**  
✅ **Uses jQuery to load and manipulate JSON data**  
✅ **Dynamically generates category selection from JSON data**  
✅ **Implements filtering functionality using jQuery**  
✅ **Styled display using CSS for better readability**  

## Hosting Notes  
 
- The **products.json** file must be hosted in the same directory for `json2.html` and `json3.html` to work correctly

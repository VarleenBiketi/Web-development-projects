## Project Overview  
This project is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game implemented using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**. Players take turns placing **X** or **O** on a **3×3 grid**, with the game detecting wins, ties, and allowing a restart.  

## File Structure  
- **`ticTacToe.html`** – Contains the game board and UI elements  
 


## Features Implemented  
✅ **Dynamically generated 3×3 grid** using JavaScript loops  
✅ **Interactive board:** Clicking places an **X** or **O** depending on the turn  
✅ **Turn tracking:** Displays whose turn it is  
✅ **Win detection:** Checks for **3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)**  
✅ **Stalemate detection:** Announces a tie if all squares are filled with no winner  
✅ **Reset button:** Clears the board and starts a new game  
✅ **Prevents overwriting moves** once an X or O is placed  
✅ **Code is modularized** with loops, functions, and arrays  

## Hosting Notes

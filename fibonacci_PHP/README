# Project README: PHP Tasks and API Implementation


## Overview

This project consists of three main tasks, each designed to practice PHP programming. The tasks involve creating a times table, using associative arrays, and developing a basic API that generates Fibonacci sequences.

## Project Tasks

### Problem 1: Times Table

- **Objective**: Create a PHP script that takes a number `n` from the query string and generates a times table for `n` from 1 to 12.

- **How it works**:
    - The script retrieves the value of `n` from the query string (e.g., `fibapi.php?n=3`).
    - It loops through numbers 1 to 12 and generates the times table for `n`.
    - The output is displayed in a simple HTML structure.

### Problem 2: Associative Arrays

- **Objective**: Create an associative array representing business office hours for each day of the week. Loop through the array to display the key-value pairs, and apply some basic CSS styling.
  
    - **CSS**: The output is styled with basic CSS to improve readability and presentation.

### Problem 3: Create an API

- **Objective**: Create a PHP file `fibapi.php` that serves as an API. The API receives a number `n` via GET data and responds with a JSON array representing the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` elements.

- **Fibonacci Sequence**:
  - The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
  - Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

- **How it works**:
    - The user sends a GET request (e.g., `fibapi.php?n=5`).
    - The script computes the Fibonacci sequence and returns the result in a JSON format.


## File Structure

- `problem1.php`: Main file for the Times Table task.
- `problem2.php`: File for the Associative Arrays task.
- `fibapi.php`: PHP API file for the Fibonacci sequence.



## Notes
- Ensure the GET method is properly used for passing parameters (`n`) in the query string.
- All CSS styling and HTML elements are included for a better presentation of the results.
